<h2>Project Title</h2>
<h3>Real Time Bus Tracker</h3>

<br><b>Description of Project</b>
<br>The Real-Time Bus Tracker is a web-based application that allows users to track the live location of Boston MBTA buses in real-time. This project leverages JavaScript along with web mapping APIs to display the current position of buses on a map interface.

<br>Features:

1. Live Bus Tracking: The application retrieves live bus location data from an API provided by MBTA.
2. Interactive Map Interface: The map interface displays the geographical area of interest and plots the current positions of buses using markers or icons.

Before running this application follow the steps below to set up your Google Maps API key
<br>Prerequisites

1. Create a Google Cloud project from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup
2. Create an API key from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

<b>How to Run:</b>

1. Clone this project to your local and replace YOUR_KEY in Index.html (line 5)
2. open Index.html in a browser

<b>Roadmap of future improvements:</b>
This is just the beginning of creating a Real-Time Bus Tracker. I will enhance this application by adding new features like Bus Information Overlay, User Location Awareness and responsive design.

Pending Features

1. Bus Information Overlay: When a user clicks on a bus marker, the application displays additional information about the bus, such as its route, destination, and estimated arrival time.
2. User Location Awareness: Optionally, the application can incorporate geolocation services to detect the user's current location and center the map accordingly.
3. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
